		<h1>Communication Features</h1>

<!--
<div class="page_separator">
</div>
<p>Here are a few of the communication based features of the classified ad and auction software.  The system generates many emails automatically for
the admin and for the client to keep each abreast of what's happening with regard to their classifieds and auctions.  Each feature is covered below
as well as a list of the actual emails the system generates.</p>
-->

<div class="items-row cols-3 row-0">
  <div class="item column-1" >

  introduce new features to clients,....etc to all users, specific user groups or specific users that match user search criteria all within
  the admin tool. 
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Enhanced Email Setting Flexibility</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_001_Envelope_admin.png" alt="">
  We have coded the software to allow any email configuration that we have ever come across.  Each host seems to have their own email configuration
  and we've made sure our software can accomodate that configuration so you can find a configuraiton that will work with your host.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Report Abuse Feature</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128_128_105_Scales.png" alt="">
  This feature allows your clients on the site to help police other clients.  This feature appears by default within the listing details page and
  allows other clients to report offensive or abusive content to you with a few clicks.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">System Generated Client Emails</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_059_Alarm-Clock.png" alt="">

  <div class="feat-list-title">CC Yourself On User Communications</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_001_Envelope_cc.png" alt="">
  If you are suspicious of some users activities on your site you can carbon copy (cc) your email for all client side communications that go through a
  feature of the software.  This allows you to zero in on scammers and spammers quickly so you can act quickly to stop them and warn your clients.
  </div>

<div class="item column-3">
<!-- column 3 -->

  <div class="feat-list-title">System Generated Admin Emails</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_001_Envelope.png" alt="">
  You can be automatically notified of a number of things happening on your site keeping your finger on the pulse of your site.
  Many of the notifications to the admin are listed below.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Get Notified Of Listing Edits</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_001_Envelope_reviewed.png" alt="">
  You can get notified of all user listing edits to the system.  Many time a spammer/scammer knows you check listings as they are entered into the
  system but not once they are in the system.  This feature will notify you of any listing edits so you can inspect them.  This just gives you another
  tool to combat scamming/spamming on your site and provide a good environment for your clients.
