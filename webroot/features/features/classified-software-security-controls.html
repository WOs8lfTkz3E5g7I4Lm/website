<p>These features provide you controls over who can access your site as well as what can be put into a listing.  There are controls to make sure
a human is actually accessing the site.  There are also many notifications to the admin use to let you know what's happening within your site so
you can act if something odd or suspicious happens.  You may notice some features mentioned here and in other feature sections as they can fulfill more
than one purpose within the auction and classified software.</p>
