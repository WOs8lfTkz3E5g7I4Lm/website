		<h1>Auction Specific Features</h1>
<div class="page_separator">
</div>

<!--
<p>These are auction specific features within our software.  The software supports a few different auction formats and several supporting
features for auctions like the feedback system.  Of course the features specific to auctions also include all features attached to listings in general.
The auction is a specific listing type in the software and includes those feature as well as those below.</p>

<p><b>The general listing features also included in the auction listing type are <a href="/classified-ad-software-and-auction-features/auction-software-specific-features/89-features-section/featured-sections/477-auction-classifieds-script-listing-features.html">shown in the listing features page here</a></b></p>

<h3 style="margin: 20px 0 0;">Types of Auctions Supported</h3>

<div class="items-row cols-3 row-0">
  <div class="item column-1" >

  <div class="feat-list-title">Buy Now Only Listings/Auctions</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_056_Shopping-Cart.png" alt="">
  This bidding or "non-bidding" configuration removes bidding from the auction leaving only the "buy now" link within the auction.  This feature
  really only includes the "auction" name because it takes advantage of all other auction features like feedback and buyer to seller gateway features.
  You have the ability at the admin to force all auctions or those in a specific price plan to be buy now auctions only...
  </div>
  <div style="font-size:80%;text-align:right;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:none;"><a href="/classified-ad-software-and-auction-features/auction-software-specific-features/88-features-section/software-features-detail-pages/490-buy-now-only-listings.html">Details</a><span style="vertical-align:middle;">
  <img src="../images/icon-flat2/128_128_125_Play.png" width="15" height="15" alt=""></span>
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Standard Auctions</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_033_auction_mallet_2.png" alt="">
  This is the base auction format where clients bid against each other for single or groups of items.  Whatever is described within the details of the
  auction is what up for bid.  There are a number of configurations possible within the software to customize the bidding experience for your clients like
  buy now option, proxy bidding,....etc
  </div>

</div>


<div class="item column-2">
<!-- column 2 -->

  <div class="feat-list-title">Buy Now Option for Auctions</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_004_Calculator.png" alt="">
  Allow your sellers to sell items immediately without the need of going through the auction process.  You can allow your clients to add this
  feature to all their auctions.  Your clients can choose to make their auction a buy now only auction without bidding at all.  In fact many
  only use the buy now only auction feature and just relabel it something other than "auction" since there would be no bidding. .
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Reverse Auctions</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_033_auction_reverse.png" alt="">
    Much like standard auctions except the bidding decreases in value instead of increasing.  With these types of auctions the roles are reversed between
  the buyer and seller.  The client placing the auction is the one purchasing.  This type of bidding is most used in bid for work/supplies or
  request for quote sites.  This allows the bidder or supplier of the service or product compete against other sellers in price to deliver to the
  buyer
  </div>

</div>
<div class="item column-3">
<!-- column 3 -->

  <div class="feat-list-title">Inventory Item Auctions</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_056_Shopping-Cart.png" alt="">
  This feature allows the seller to sell individual items of a quantity to different buyers from the same auction.  Like buy it now there is no bidding
  within this feature yet still takes advantage of other auction features like feeback and buyer to seller gateway.  The seller inserts a quantity of the
  same items they will sell within the listing and buyers can choose up to the quantity left when they click "buy now".  If the buyer does not choose
  the quantity left what they do purchase is removed from the total so another buyer can buy...

  <div class="feat-list-title">Dutch Auctions</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_033_auction_dutch.png" alt="">
  With this type of auction there are multiple items up for auction and each bidder can win one or more of the total quantity.  While the final bid paid
  for each item is determined by the lowest winning bidder the higher bidders are guaranteed their full quantities.  Make sure to read the details on
  this feature as we've had clients with other definitions of what a dutch auction is.
  </div>

</div>
</div>

<h3 style="margin: 20px 0 0;">Auction Supporting Features</h3>
<!--
<p>These features serve to make for a better and safer auction experience for your site.  There are configurations to the auction bidding process,
features to control who can bid, feedback features to help remove bad clients from the system and others.</p>
-->
<div class="items-row cols-3 row-0">
  <div class="item column-1" >

  <div class="feat-list-title">Final/Closing Fees</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_033_auction_final_fees.png" alt="">
  You can charge a fee to the seller at the end of the auction based on the final bid of the auction.  This fee is only charged to the seller and only
  if the auction was successful.  You can set the software to charge a percentage or flat fee based on the final price of the auction.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Multiple Auction Bidding Configurations</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_033_auction_mallet.png" alt="">
  With auctions in our system you can configure bidding in a number of ways.  There is proxy bidding where the bidder inserts their max bid and
  the system bids for them up to that max.  There is straight bidding where bids are entered without a proxy system.  You can allow straight
  bidding till the reserve met then use proxy bidding.  Allow the current high bidder to raise their bid if you like. 
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Active Bids Status Page</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_011_Clipboard.png" alt="">
  This allows your clients to see at a glance the bids they have on live and recently expired auctions.  This will show the current status of their
  bids on those auction like whether they won, are winning, are losing or have lost.  Also the "pay seller" link provided by the seller to buyer
  gateway feature would appear here so the buyer could pay the seller directly through paypal.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Auction Extension/Endless Auction</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_033_auction_endless.png" alt="">
    This can also be called the anti-sniper bidding feature.  One thing that can frustrate bidders on your site is to lose an auction at the last minute
  because there's not enough time to get a bid in.  Many bidders wait till the last few seconds of an auction to bid just for this reason.  This feature
  will automatically extend an auction by a certain amount of time if a bid is received within a certain amount of time of the auction end.  This makes
  both your seller (higher prices) and buyers (chance to win) happy.
  </div>

</div>


<div class="item column-2">
<!-- column 2 -->

  <div class="feat-list-title">Ban From Bidding Feature</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128_128_170_Delete.png" alt="">
  Sellers can stop individual users from bidding on their systems.  There can be a number of reasons ranging from the need to ban their
  competition from bidding on their auctions to simply not liking the experience with a specific buyer and the desire to not deal with
  them any more...for what ever reason this gives your sellers better control over their auctions on the site certainly raising their
  comfort level with your site.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Feedback System</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128_128_105_Scales.png" alt="">
  With the feedback system your clients can protect themselves and your site from bad buyers and sellers on the site.  One bad seller can ruin
  the taste of many other users on your site and the feedback system allows them to personally rate anyone they complete an auction within the
  site.  As transactions build on your site good sellers are rewarded with higher prices for their good service and good buyers are rewarded
  with greater access and trust from sellers and smoother transactions. 
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Bid History for Auctions</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_002_auction_history.png" alt="">
  This feature allows clients to view the bid history from within the auction details page.  There are configurations so that you can allow the
  bid history link to appear when the auction is still live or only after the auction has expired.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Client Can Edit Till First Bid</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128_128_177_Edit.png" alt="">
   Once a bid is placed there is an agreement between the buyer and seller.  The system can be configured to allow for auction editing up till the
  first bid but not after.  Stopping auction edits after the first bid will stop a lot of disputes between the buyer and seller after the winner is
  determined.  Just another tool to keep your site hospitable.
  </div>

</div>
<div class="item column-3">
<!-- column 3 -->

  <p>
  <div class="feat-list-title">Proxy Bidding for Standard Auctions</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_033_auction_mallet.png" alt="">
  This feature allows aucton bidders to set their maximum bid they are willing to go and not need to return to the auction to make sure they are not outbid
  within their price range.  The system will bid for the proxy bidder automatically until their max is met.  This essentially allows the bidder to make
  one hassle free bid to their max where they would only pay that max if there are other bidders willing to bid against them. 
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Allow to Bid Feature</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128_128_171_Thumbs-Up.png" alt="">
  Also called the <b>approved bidder/buyer</b> or <b>invited bidder/buyer</b> feature.  Some auction sellers may only want to allow
  specific bidders to enter bids on their auctions.  This allows for sellers to prequalify
  bidders on their auctions or just allow them further control over the bidders and eventual buyers they settle with after the auction.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Set Auction Bid Start and End Times</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_002_auction_history.png" alt="">
  Your client can have the ability to set exact start and end times for their auctions.  You as the admin control whether this ability is allowed or not.
  Once the auction is placed it is visible on the client side but will not accept bids until the start time set within the auction placement process.  The
  auction will end at the exact time set by the seller unless you have the endless/anti-sniper feature turned on.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Bid Increment Management</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128_128_254_Scissors.png" alt="">
  You as the admin control the necessary minimum amount a bid must be raised from the current high bid before it will be accepted.  This allows
  you protect multiple thousand dollar bidders from losing an auction by a penny....making for an angry bidder and possibly losing a client.

<h3  style="margin: 20px 0 0;">System Generated Emails within the Auction Feature</h3>
