<h3>Language Specific Features</h3>
<div class="page_separator">
</div>
<p>These features allow you to customize the software to specific languages or specific regions.  All client side text and templates can be language
specific but different features can be necessarily accommodate multiple languages, currencies and regions.</p>

<div class="items-row cols-3 row-0">
  <div class="item column-1" >

  <div class="feat-list-title">Support More Than One Language At A Time</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_028_Earth.png" alt="">
  The choice is yours as to how many sites you support on your site.  You can support just one or many languages.  You set a default language the
  site will display in and give your clients a choice if you support more than one language.  
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Browse Filter For Languages Available</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_046_Chat.png" alt="">
  The language selected when placing a listing is saved within that listings details.  You can turn on/off a filter so that users browsing the site in one
  language only see listings placed using that language.  This reduces the number of listings they can't understand anyway to just the ones they can
  understand and are most likely in their area anyway.  Just another tool to get the right listings in front of your clients faster.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Control Date/Time Display Format</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_015_Calendar.png" alt="">
  Each region, language and sometimes discipline expects a date in a specific format.  You have different controls for the date display format in a few
  different features of the software.
  </div>

<div class="item column-2">

  <div class="feat-list-title">Built In Language Choice Feature</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128_128_172_Settings.png" alt="">
  This allows your clients to choose between the languages your site supports.  You can point your clients to the language choice page but the software's
  flexibility allows you to simply insert links within your design to switch between languages.  Most clients create "flag links" within their design
  to switch between languages. 
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Set Country By IP Address</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_012_Map.png" alt="">
  Using an external IP address service you can have the country set within the Geographic Navigation filter the first time your clients come to your site.
  If your site has an international audience this feature sets their filter to only view listings in their country without needing to make a choice. 
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Set a Template Set Per Language</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_021_Website.png" alt="">
  While this is mainly to allow you to put language specific text within the design this can also allow you to show a different design to each language
  that uses your site.  A specific design may work better for a specific language and the software allows you to.
  </div>

</div>
<div class="item column-3">
<!-- column 3 -->

  <div class="feat-list-title">Multiple Currency Display</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_048_Coin.png" alt="">
  Allow your clients a choice of currencies they wish to display their items in.  You control their choices and they choose the currency their prices
  will display in.  You set both the prefix and suffix for the price display.  Note software does not do any currency conversion.

  <div class="feat-list-title">Phone Number Formatting Abilties</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128_128_175_Phone.png" alt="">
  While your clients can enter the phone numbers attached to their listings in any way if your site focuses on a specific region the software can
  automatically format those phone numbers to a format of your choosing.  Of course you can always choose to leave the phone number display as is.
