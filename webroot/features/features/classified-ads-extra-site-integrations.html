  <div class="feat-list-title">RSS Feature to Share With Other Sites</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/rss-icon.jpg" alt="">
  The built in RSS feature allows you to extend your site reach beyond your domain.  You have the ability to create RSS feeds that have
  the listings you want within them based on many criteria to choose them from the database.  You can create many different RSS feeds to
  supply listing content to many different sites selecting those listings on criteria that will make those listing match the sites/locations
  they'll appear in.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Personalized Iphone App Available</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_005_Mobile-Devices.png" alt="">
  Provides much of the same funcitonality than the shared app but is your site own app branded, colored and packaged specifically for your site.  You
  control the colors, images and the icon used for the app and this app ONLY connects to your site exclusively.  It's uploaded and to the Apple App
  Store as your app with your name and downloadable for any of your clients.

  <div class="feat-list-title">Affiliate System Integration</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128_128_217_Cup.png" alt="">
  Our software can be integrated with Idevaffiliate and Post Affiliate Pro softwares so you can keep track of what sites send you clients that actually
  spend money on your site.  Their software keeps track of where clients come from and how much they spend to you can appropriately reward those sites that
  send you clients.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Free Shared Iphone App Use</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_005_Mobile-Devices.png" alt="">
  With each license purchase you are given free access the GeoMobile Iphone app.  The shared app has general Geo marking within the app but will
  connect with your site for searches and auctions or classified ad display.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Bridge Users To Other Geo Installations</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128x128_067_User_to_user.png" alt="">
  If you have muliple installations of our software you can sync users between the two or more installations of your Geo software.  If the installations
  are on the same url login for all installations could be through one common login.  You only need to make sure all installations can talk to the
  other installations databases.

  <div class="feat-list-title">Remote API</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128_128_197_Antenna.png" alt="">
  Probably the most powerful tool you have in integrating our software with other software and even other sites.  This allows other software to
  securely connect to the Geo software and run preprogrammed requests from or insertions into the GeoCore software database.  Current calls
  include user registration, listing search, listings per user and several more.  More can always be added to suit your needs.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">Push to Oodle Feed</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/128_128_oodle.jpg" alt="">
  This feature allows you to optionally push listings inserted into your site to oodle.com.  This allows your clients to insert their listing on your site yet stretch that listings reach far beyond your site.
  </div>

  <div class="feat-list-title">User Integration With Joomla</div>
  <div class="feat-list-text"><img src="../images/icon-flat2/joomla_icon.jpg" alt="">
  Using the JFusion plugin provided free you can share users between your GeoCore software and your Joomla installation.  This allows you one login
  to get access to both softwares.  Once integrated with Joomla you can easily and seemlessly use our software and Joomla features and extensions
  together under one user session control.
